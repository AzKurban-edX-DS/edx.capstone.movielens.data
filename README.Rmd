# edx.capstone.movielens.data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `edx.capstone.movielens.data`  is to provide the following datasets derived from the  [10M version of the MovieLens Dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/) to use in the _**MovieLens**_ project of the [edX HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science Capstone Course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.9x+3T2024/home) for building a _Movie Recommendation System_ according to the course requirements:
* **edx:** use it to develop and train your algorithms;
* **final_holdout_test:** As per the course instructions, use it exclusively to evaluate the _**RMSE**_ of your final algorithm.


## Installation

You can install the development version of edx.capstone.movielens.data from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("AzKurban-edX-DS/edx.capstone.movielens.data")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(edx.capstone.movielens.data)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
